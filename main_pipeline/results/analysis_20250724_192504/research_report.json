      "description": "While GLP-1R agonists are recognized for their distributed CNS effects on metabolism and specific actions on arcuate neurons for weight loss, recent evidence highlights their profound neuroprotective capabilities in neurodegenerative conditions. The precise central neuronal circuits mediating these distinct neuroprotective benefits, particularly those involving specific afferent pathways like Glp1r VANS, are poorly understood, presenting a critical gap in harnessing their full therapeutic potential. Employ advanced circuit-mapping and optogenetic strategies to identify and functionally characterize the specific populations of GLP-1R-expressing neurons and their associated pathways within the central nervous system, including potentially distinct vagal afferent circuits, that are primarily responsible for the observed neuroprotective effects of GLP-1R agonists, thereby differentiating them from known metabolic pathways.",

Validating distributed CNS pathways will reveal the complex neural circuitry underlying GLP-1RA efficacy in weight reduction, potentially paving the way for more nuanced therapeutic strategies for obesity and metabolic disorders. To validate this hypothesis, research should focus on experimentally mapping the functional contributions of GLP-1 receptors across various CNS regions, rather than isolating single sites.

      "description": "Metabolic diseases like obesity involve impaired integration of peripheral signals by hypothalamic POMC neurons, yet the precise synaptic mechanisms governing this dysfunction remain elusive. Current bulk approaches struggle to delineate dynamic changes in excitatory and inhibitory inputs. Applying high-resolution electrophysiology, as demonstrated for GLP-1's direct stimulation of POMC and indirect GABA-dependent inhibition of NPY/AgRP, offers a direct means to unravel specific synaptic adaptations in POMC neurons that drive metabolic imbalance, particularly the critical role of indirect GABAergic modulation. We propose to utilize electrophysiological recordings from POMC neurons in hypothalamic brain slices from murine models of diet-induced obesity. This approach will allow us to precisely characterize how chronic metabolic stress alters the intrinsic excitability, and the balance of excitatory and indirect GABAergic inhibitory synaptic inputs (e.g., from NPY/AgRP neurons), onto POMC neurons. By comparing responses to key metabolic hormones (e.g., leptin, insulin) in slices from obese versus lean animals, we can identify specific dysfunctional synaptic circuits contributing to the impaired energy balance observed in metabolic disease.",

Current strategies often target specific immune pathways, but a broader intervention influencing systemic aging, as suggested by the R-Cu methodology, could offer a breakthrough in restoring robust adaptive immunity in aged hosts. This research proposes to evaluate if long-term oral R-Cu supplementation, initiated in middle-aged C57BL/6 mice (from 10 months of age for 12 months as per the method), can significantly ameliorate immunosenescence by enhancing adaptive immune cell function and improving vaccine-induced antibody responses and protection against age-related infections.",

The specific contribution and precise neural control of endogenously released GLP-1 from brainstem Preproglucagon (PPG)-expressing neurons in the Nucleus Tractus Solitarius (PPGNTS) to sustained satiety and weight loss remain underexplored. Directly and precisely activating these specific satiety-promoting neurons could offer unprecedented insight into the physiological mechanisms of endogenous appetite control and provide a novel, targeted therapeutic avenue.

Subsequent chemogenetic activation would allow for real-time investigation of how precisely increasing the activity of these neurons impacts food intake, body weight trajectory, energy expenditure, and glucose homeostasis.

      "description": "The widespread clinical use of semaglutide for weight management and type 2 diabetes is frequently hampered by variable individual responses and significant gastrointestinal side effects that lead to poor adherence. While the current method effectively evaluates semaglutide's impact on food intake and body weight after subchronic administration in DIO rodent models, its potential to systematically map precise dosing regimens to long-term efficacy and tolerability profiles remains under-explored as a translational tool. We propose to leverage the subchronic semaglutide administration protocol in DIO mice and rats to precisely characterize dose-response curves for weight loss and concurrently monitor markers of adverse gastrointestinal events over extended periods. By varying initial titration rates, maintenance doses, and administration frequencies, this approach aims to identify optimal pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profiles that maximize sustained weight reduction and metabolic improvements while critically minimizing side effects, thereby informing more individualized and tolerable clinical dosing strategies.",

We propose to leverage differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) as a primary or orthogonal screening method for large compound libraries or fragment sets to identify novel direct binders of IDO1. This approach will enable the rapid identification of diverse chemical scaffolds that physically interact with IDO1, distinguishing them from compounds that might indirectly affect IDO1 activity or act via other mechanisms.
