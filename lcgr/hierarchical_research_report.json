This contrasts with the precise localization of metabolic GLP-1R populations (e.g., ARC POMC/CART neurons), suggesting a potential divergence in the anatomical and functional substrate of GLP-1R's diverse actions. Utilize advanced chemogenetic or optogenetic techniques (e.g., DREADDs as in Glp1rVANs) to precisely activate or inhibit specific GLP-1R-expressing neuronal populations outside known metabolic centers (e.g., ARC, brainstem nuclei) in relevant mouse models of neurodegenerative diseases.

              "description": "The development of specific and potent IDO1 inhibitors for cancer immunotherapy has been hampered by the challenges of distinguishing direct enzymatic inhibition from cellular context effects in drug screening assays. The novel method, which determines IDO1 inhibition using a defined cytochrome P450 reductase/NADPH and cytochrome b5 system, offers a highly controlled and physiologically relevant cell-free environment to precisely measure direct IDO1 activity, thereby overcoming the limitations of complex cellular assays. Implement a high-throughput screening platform utilizing this reconstituted IDO1 enzymatic assay to identify novel, direct, and potent IDO1 inhibitors with enhanced specificity, ultimately accelerating the discovery of more effective therapeutic candidates for immune-oncology.",

              "description": "Despite Microcebus murinus serving as a crucial model for human brain aging and neurodegenerative diseases, the precise, dynamic relationship between metabolic health and the progressive onset of neurodegenerative pathologies remains poorly understood. Current research often lacks the longitudinal resolution to link early metabolic shifts to the long-term trajectory of cognitive decline and brain atrophy, hindering the identification of critical intervention points. We propose to implement a comprehensive, longitudinal monitoring program in Microcebus murinus from early adulthood, integrating detailed metabolic assessments (e.g., regular measurements of glucose, insulin, lipid profiles, inflammatory markers, body composition via DEXA) with established readouts of cognitive and motor performance, in vivo brain imaging for atrophy, and post-mortem neuropathological analyses. By subjecting different cohorts to controlled dietary interventions or pharmacological modulators of metabolism, this approach will enable the discovery of specific metabolic signatures and trajectories that reliably predict the onset and progression of neurodegenerative phenotypes, thus revealing novel early biomarkers and mechanistic pathways for intervention.",

              "description": "Despite its efficacy in weight management, a significant challenge with semaglutide is the rapid weight regain often observed upon treatment discontinuation. Current clinical studies are limited in their ability to precisely control variables and perform invasive mechanistic assessments during and after drug withdrawal. A subchronic administration model in DIO rodents provides a controlled environment to longitudinally track metabolic adaptations, energy balance, and neurohumoral changes post-semaglutide cessation, offering insights into the mechanisms driving weight regain. Subchronic administration of semaglutide to diet-induced obese (DIO) mice or rats, followed by a washout period, would allow for comprehensive evaluation of persistent metabolic changes, food intake patterns, body weight trajectories, and underlying neuroendocrine or metabolic adaptations that contribute to weight regain after semaglutide cessation. This approach can identify critical time points and physiological markers associated with relapse.",

The novel method, utilizing purified ferric IDO1 with specific ascorbic acid reduction and methylene blue as an electron carrier, offers a precisely controlled and potentially more physiologically relevant in vitro system to evaluate IDO1 activity and inhibition, addressing a critical gap in drug discovery. We propose establishing a high-throughput screening platform based on this redox-controlled ferric IDO1 assay to identify and characterize novel IDO1 inhibitors, thereby improving the predictability of in vitro potency for in vivo efficacy and accelerating the development of more effective immunotherapeutic agents for cancer and chronic inflammatory diseases.",
